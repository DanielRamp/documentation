## ZFS Feature Flag Removal 

### Executive Summary

* ZFS `xattr_compat` feature flag removed

### How to tell if I'm impacted by this change

* Users who created or upgraded a pool using a TrueNAS SCALE nightly build dated between June 29, 2021 and July 15, 2021 are impacted by this change.
* Users who have manually set `xattr_compat=all` on a dataset and written an xattr are impacted by this change.
* If unsure, you can verify a pool's status of the `xattr_compat` feature flag. If the flag is in the active state, you are impacted by this change.

### How to resolve this if I am impacted

* Any pool that has had the feature active, must be backed up and restored into a pool created on a version of ZFS without the feature. For details on how to perform data protection procedures, please refer to the TrueNAS SCALE [Data Protection]({{< relref "SCALE/DataProtection/_index.md" >}}) documentation.
