**October 8, 2021**

TrueNAS SCALE 21.08-BETA.2 has been released! This is a maintenance release that includes an undisclosed security update and improvements for SMB/NFSv4 protocols while development looks ahead to the upcoming SCALE 22.02-RC.1 release later this month.

We appreciate the [community feedback](https://www.truenas.com/community/forums/truenas-scale-discussion/) and [bug reports](https://jira.ixsystems.com/) and hope to get all those features to RELEASE quality faster. A special thanks also goes to the large number of awesome community members who joined the development and test team. Weâ€™ve really appreciated your contributions and teamwork and it has greatly contributed to the accelerated development process.
