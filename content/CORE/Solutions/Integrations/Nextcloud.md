If the catalog doesn't load:

Plugins are organized into two **Collections**:

By default, this location stores all data related to applications, including downloaded applications, data managed by applications, and any application snapshots.

{{< hint warning >}}
 Disconnecting or deleting the pool that stores application data can result in **permanent data loss!** Make sure to back up any critical data or snapshots that are stored in a application before changing the storage configuration.

To change the applications storage location, click *Settings* on the Applications page and select *Choose Pool* from the dropdown menu.
