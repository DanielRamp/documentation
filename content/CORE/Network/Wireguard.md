[WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com/) is a popular option in the VPN marketplace due to its speed, simplicity, and modern cryptography standards.
Starting with FreeNAS version 11.3-RC1 and continuing through TrueNAS 12.0, it is possible to connect your NAS directly to a WireGuard network with a few easy steps.

Start by creating some custom tunables to enable the service and give it a default interface.
Log in to the TrueNAS web interface and go to **System > Tunables > Add**.
Use these settings to enable the service:

* *Variable* = `wireguard_enable`
* *Value* = `YES`
* *Type* = `rc.conf`

Next, create another tunable to define the networking interface:

* *Variable* = `wireguard_interfaces`
* *Value* = `wg0`
* *Type* = `rc.conf`

![WireguardInterface](/images/CORE/12.0/wireguard_interfaces.png "Wireguard Interfaces")

When finished, you will have these two variables set and enabled:

Next, we need a post-init script that places the WireGuard config in the correct location at startup.
Go to **Tasks > Init/Shutdown Scripts** and click *Add*.
Configure the script to load the WireGuard `.conf` file each time the system boots:

* *Type* = `Command` 
* *Command* = `mkdir -p /usr/local/etc/wireguard && cp /root/wg0.conf /usr/local/etc/wireguard/wg0.conf && /usr/local/etc/rc.d/wireguard start`
* *When* = `Post Init`

You can configure the `/root/wg0.conf` file and apply a WireGuard configuration to attach to whatever WireGuard network you define.
It can be a single point-to-point to anything running WireGuard or even use full routing.
Example use cases are:

* Access data on a NAS from your Remote Laptop
* Linking NAS to NAS for replication
* Attaching a managed NAS to a remote network
* Access to your NAS from your smartphone

Now create the `/root/wg0.conf` that contains the specific WireGuard configuration to apply at boot.
This file settings are dependent on your specific networking environment and requirements, which is beyond the scope of this article.
There are [quickstart guides](https://www.wireguard.com/quickstart/) and [tutorials](https://www.linode.com/docs/networking/vpn/set-up-wireguard-vpn-on-ubuntu/) available online as well as the built-in `wg-quick` manpage.

Once you have a valid `/root/wg0.conf`, rebooting the system brings up the WireGuard interface and youâ€™ll see a `wg0` device in the output of `ifconfig`.

Congratulations, you have successfully linked your TrueNAS system to a secure WireGuard tunnel!
