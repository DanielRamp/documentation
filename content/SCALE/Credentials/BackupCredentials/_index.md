The **Backup Credentials** section lets users integrate TrueNAS with Cloud Storage providers and set up SSH Connections and Keypairs.

![BackupCredentialsSCALE](/images/SCALE/BackupCredentialsSCALE.png "Backup Credentials Screen")

{{< tabs "Credential Types" >}}
{{< tab "Cloud Credentials" >}}
The *Cloud Credentials* window allows users to integrate TrueNAS with Cloud Storage providers. 

{{< expand "Is this secure?" "v" >}}
To maximize security, TrueNAS encrypts cloud credentials when saving them.
However, this means that to restore any cloud credentials from a TrueNAS configuration file, you must enable *Export Password Secret Seed* when generating that [configuration backup]({{< relref "GeneralSettings.md" >}}).
Remember to protect any downloaded TrueNAS configuration files.
{{< /expand >}}

We recommend users open another browser tab open and log in to the Cloud Storage Provider account you intend to link with TrueNAS.
Some providers require additional information that they generate on the storage provider account page.
For example, saving an Amazon S3 credential on TrueNAS could require logging in to the S3 account and generating an access key pair on the *Security Credentials > Access Keys* page.

To set up a Cloud Credential, go to **Credentials > Backup Credentials** and click *Add* in the *Cloud Credentials* window.

![CloudCredentialsSCALE](/images/SCALE/CloudCredentialsSCALE.png "Cloud Credentials Form")

Enter a credential *Name* and choose a *Provider*. The rest of the options change according to the chosen *Provider*:

Enter the required *Authentication* strings to enable saving the credential.

## Automatic Authentication

Some providers can automatically populate the required *Authentication* strings by logging in to the account.
To automatically configure the credential, click *Login to Provider* and entering your account username and password.

![AutomaticAuthenticationSCALE](/images/SCALE/AutomaticAuthenticationSCALE.png "Cloud Automatic Authentication")

We recommend verifying the credential before saving it.
{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab "SSH Connections" >}}
The *SSH Connections* window in the **Backup Credentials** screen allows users establish [Secure Socket Shell (SSH)](https://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/Secure-Shell) connections.

To begin setting up a SSH Connection, navigate to **Credentials > Backup Credentials** and click the *Add* button in the *SSH Connections* window.

## Create a Connection

{{< expand "Semi-Automatic" "v" >}}
Semi-automatic simplifies setting up an SSH connection with another FreeNAS or TrueNAS system without logging in to that system to transfer SSH keys.
This requires an SSH keypair on the local system and administrator account credentials for the remote TrueNAS.
You must configure the remote system to allow root access with SSH.
You can generate the keypair as part of the semiautomatic configuration or a manually created one in **Backup Credentials**.

![SSHConnectionsSCALE](/images/SCALE/SSHConnectionsSCALE.png "SSH Connections Form")

{{< include file="static/includes/Reference/SystemSSHConnectionsAddSemiAutoFields.md.part" markdown="true" >}}

Be sure to use a valid URL scheme for the remote TrueNAS URL.
Leave the username as *root* and enter the account password for the remote TrueNAS system.
You can import the private key from a previously created SSH keypair or create one with a new SSH keypair.

Saving the new configuration automatically opens a connection to the remote TrueNAS and exchanges SSH keys.
{{< /expand >}}
{{< expand "Manual" "v" >}}
To manually set up an SSH connection, you must copy a public encryption key from the local system to the remote system.
A manual setup allows a secure connection without a password prompt.

### Adding a Public SSH Key to the TrueNAS Root Account

Log in to the TrueNAS system that generated the SSH keypair and go to **Credentials > Backup Credentials**. Click the <i class="material-icons" aria-hidden="true">more_vert</i>.
Open the keypair for the SSH connection and copy the text of the public SSH key or download the public key as a text file.

Log in to the TrueNAS system you want to register the public key on and go to **Credentials > Local Users**.
Edit the *root* account.
Paste the SSH public key text into the **SSH Public Key** field.
![AccountsUsersRootSSHKeySCALE](/images/SCALE/AccountsUsersRootSSHKeySCALE.png "Accounts Users Root SSH Key")

Start by generating a new SSH keypair in **Credentials > Backup Credentials**.
Copy or download the value for the public key.
Add the public key to the remote NAS.
If the remote NAS is not a TrueNAS system, please see the documentation for that system for instructions on adding a public SSH key.

### Manually Configuring the SSH Connection on the Local TrueNAS

Log back in to the local TrueNAS system. Go to **Credentials > Backup Credentials** and add a new SSH connection.
Change the setup method to *Manual*.

![SSHConnectionsManualSCALE](/images/SCALE/SSHConnectionsManualSCALE.png "SSH Connections: Manual Options")

{{< include file="static/includes/Reference/SystemSSHConnectionsAddManualFields.md.part" markdown="true" >}}

Select the private key from the SSH keypair that you used to transfer the public key on the remote NAS.
{{< /expand >}}

{{< tab "SSH Keypairs" >}}
TrueNAS generates and stores [RSA-encrypted](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8017) SSH public and private keypairs in **Credentials > Backup Credentials**.
Keypairs are generally used when configuring **SSH Connections** or SFTP **Cloud Credentials**.
TrueNAS does not support encrypted keypairs or keypairs with passphrases.

TrueNAS automatically generates keypairs as needed when creating new **SSH Connections** or **Replication** tasks.
To manually create a new keypair, go to **System > SSH Keypairs**, click *ADD*, and give the keypair a unique *Name*.

## Creating an SSH Keypair

![AccountsUsersRootSSHKeySCALE](/images/SCALE/AccountsUsersRootSSHKeySCALE.png "SSH Keypairs Form")

Clicking *Generate Keypair* adds values to the public and private key fields.
Copy these strings or download them into text files for later use.
