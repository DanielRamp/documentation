[S.M.A.R.T.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.M.A.R.T.) (Self-Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting Technology) is a standard for disk monitoring and testing.
You can monitor disks for problems using different kinds of self-tests.
TrueNAS can adjust when it issues S.M.A.R.T. alerts.
When S.M.A.R.T. monitoring reports a disk issue, we recommend you replace that disk.
Most modern ATA, IDE, and SCSI-3 hard drives support S.M.A.R.T.
Refer to your respective drive documentation for confirmation.

TrueNAS runs S.M.A.R.T. tests on disks.
Running tests can reduce drive performance, so we recommend scheduling tests when the system is in a low-usage state.
Avoid scheduling disk-intensive tests at the same time!
For example, don't schedule S.M.A.R.T. tests on the same day as a disk [scrub]({{< relref "ScrubTasksSCALE.md" >}}) or other Data Protection task.

{{< expand "How do I check or change S.M.A.R.T. testing for a disk?" "v" >}}
Go to **Storage**, then click the **Disks** drop-down and select **Disks**.

Click the <i class="material-icons" aria-hidden="true">expand_more</i> in a disk's row to expand it.
*Enable S.M.A.R.T.* shows as *true* or *false*.

To enable or disable testing, click **EDIT** and find the **Enable S.M.A.R.T.** option.

## Manual S.M.A.R.T. Test

To quickly test one or more disk for errors, select the disks you want to test and click **MANUAL TEST**.

![SMARTTestsQuickSCALE](/images/SCALE/SMARTTestsQuickSCALE.png "Manual Test Options")

Next, select the test **Type**.
Test types differ based on the drive connection, ATA or SCSI:
{{< tabs "Tests by Drive Connection" >}}
{{< tab "ATA" >}}
* **Long** runs a S.M.A.R.T. Extended Self Test that scans the entire disk surface, which may take hours on large-volume disks.
* **Short** runs a basic S.M.A.R.T. Short Self Test (usually under ten minutes) that varies by manufacturer.
* **Conveyance** runs a S.M.A.R.T. Conveyance Self Test (usually only minutes) that identifies damage incurred while transporting the device.
* **Offline** runs a S.M.A.R.T. Immediate Offline Test that updates the S.M.A.R.T. Attribute values. Errors will appear in the S.M.A.R.T. error log.

{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab "SCSI" >}}
* **Long** runs the "Background long" self-test.
* **Short** runs the "Background short" self-test.
* **Offline** runs the default self-test in the foreground, but doesn't place an entry in the self-test log.

For more information, refer to [smartctl(8)](https://www.smartmontools.org/browser/trunk/smartmontools/smartctl.8.in).

Click **START** to begin the test.
Test duration varies based on the test type you chose.
TrueNAS generates alerts when tests discover issues.

{{< expand "Where can I view the test results?" "v" >}}
Click the <i class="material-icons" aria-hidden="true">expand_more</i> in a disk's row to expand it, then click **S.M.A.R.T. TEST RESULTS**.
You can also see results in the **[Shell]({{< relref "SCALEShell.md" >}})** using `smartctl` and the name of the drive: `smartctl -l selftest /dev/ada0`.

## Automatic S.M.A.R.T. Tests

To schedule recurring S.M.A.R.T. tests, go to **Data Protection** and click **ADD** in the **S.M.A.R.T. Tests** window.

![SMARTTestsAddSCALE](/images/SCALE/SMARTTestsAddSCALE.png "Add recurring S.M.A.R.T. test")

{{< expand "Specific Options" "v" >}}
{{< include file="static/includes/Reference/TasksSMARTAddFields.md.part" markdown="true" >}}
{{< /expand >}}

Choose the **Disks** to test, the test **Type** to run, and the task's **Schedule**.

{{< hint warning >}}
S.M.A.R.T. tests can offline disks! Avoid scheduling S.M.A.R.T. tests simultaneously with scrub or other data protection tasks.
{{< /hint >}}

If you need the test to run on a specific **Schedule**, choose **Custom** to open the advanced scheduler.
{{< expand "Advanced Scheduler" "v" >}}
{{< include file="static/includes/SCALE/SCALEAdvancedScheduler.md.part" markdown="true" >}}
{{< /expand >}}

Saved schedules appear in the **S.M.A.R.T. Tests** window.

{{< expand "CLI" "v" >}}
To verify the schedule is saved, you can open the [shell]({{< relref "SCALEShell.md" >}}) and enter `smartd -q showtests`.

## Service Options

You must enable the S.M.A.R.T. service to run automatic S.M.A.R.T. tests.

{{< expand "RAID controllers?" "v" >}}
Disable the S.M.A.R.T. service when a RAID controller controlls the disks.
The controller monitors S.M.A.R.T. separately and marks disks as a **Predictive Failure** on a test failure.
{{< /expand >}}

To start the S.M.A.R.T. service, go to **System Settings > Services** and toggle **S.M.A.R.T.**.
To start the service during the TrueNAS boot process, set **Start Automatically**.

Configure the S.M.A.R.T. service by clicking <i class="material-icons" aria-hidden="true" title="Configure">edit</i>.
