A Virtual Machine (VM) is an environment on a host computer that you can use as if it were a separate, physical computer.
Users can use VMs to run multiple operating systems simultaneously on a single computer.
Operating systems running inside a VM see emulated virtual hardware rather than the host computer's physical hardware.
VMs provide more isolation than Jails but will also consume more system resources.

## Creating a Virtual Machine

Before creating a virtual machine, you need an installer <file>.iso</file> or image file for the OS you intend to install, and a [storage pool]({{< relref "/SCALE/Storage/_index.md" >}}) available for both the virtual disk and OS install file.

To create a new VM, go to **Virtualization** and click *Add* (or *Add Virtual Machines*).
Configure each category of the VM according to your specifications, starting with the *Operating System*.

{{< include file="static/includes/Reference/VirtualMachinesAddFieldsSCALE.md.part" markdown="true" >}}

Additional notes:

* Compare the recommended specifications for your guest operating system with the available host system resources when allocating *Virtual CPUs*, *Cores*, *Threads*, and *Memory Size*.
* Don't allocate too much memory to a VM.
  Activating a VM with all available memory allocated to it can slow the host system or prevent other VMs from starting.
* We recommend using the *AHCI* *Disk Type* for Windows VMs.
* The *VirtIO* network interface requires a guest OS that supports VirtIO paravirtualized network drivers.

### Adding and Removing Devices

After creating the VM, add and remove virtual devices by expanding the VM entry in **Virtualization** and clicking <i class="material-icons" aria-hidden="true" title="Devices">device_hub</i>*Devices*.

![VirtualMachinesDevicesSCALE](/images/SCALE/VirtualMachinesDevicesSCALE.png "VM Devices")

Device notes:

* The virtual machine attempts to boot from devices according to the *Device Order*, starting with *1000*, then ascending.
* *CD-ROM* devices allow booting a VM from a CD-ROM image like an installation CD.
  The CD image must be available in the system storage.

## Managing the Virtual Machine

After creating the VM and configuring any devices for it, manage the VM by expanding its entry in **Virtualization**.

![VirtualMachinesOptionsSCALE](/images/SCALE/VirtualMachinesOptionsSCALE.png "VM Options")

When the VM is active, it will display options for <i class="material-icons" aria-hidden="true" title="VNC">settings_ethernet</i> *Display* and <i class="material-icons" aria-hidden="true" title="Serial">keyboard_arrow_right</i> *Serial* connections.

If the *Display* connection screen appears distorted, try adjusting the display device resolution.

Using the *State* toggle or clicking <i class="material-icons" aria-hidden="true" title="Stop Button">stop</i> *Stop* follows a standard shut down procedure to cleanly shut down the running VM.
Clicking <i class="material-icons" aria-hidden="true" title="Power Off Button">power_settings_new</i> *Power Off* immediately halts and deactivates the VM, similar to unplugging a computer.

{{< hint info >}}
If the VM you created has no Guest OS installed, The VM *State* toggle and <i class="material-icons" aria-hidden="true" title="Stop Button">stop</i> *Stop* button might not function as expected.
The *State* toggle and <i class="material-icons" aria-hidden="true" title="Stop Button">stop</i> *Stop* button send an ACPI power down command to the VM operating system, but since no OS is installed, the commands time out.
Use the *Power Off* button instead.

## Installing an OS

When the VM is configured in TrueNAS and has an OS '.iso' attached, you can start the VM and begin installing the operating system.

{{< hint info >}}
Some operating systems can require specific settings to function properly in a virtual machine. For example, vanilla Debian can require advanced partitioning when installing the OS. Please refer to the documentation for your chosen Operating System for tips and configuration instructions.
{{< /hint >}}

Here is an example of installing a Debian OS in a TrueNAS VM. The Debian `.iso` was uploaded to the TrueNAS system and attached to the VM as a *CD-ROM* device. 

* Click on the **Virtualization** menu then click *ADD* to start the VM creation process using the wizard.

![SCALEDebianVMOperatingSystem](/images/SCALE/ScaleDebianVMOsSystem.png "Debian VM Add: OS")

{{< expand "VM values entered for the Debian Example." "v" >}}

**Operating System:**
* Guest Operating System: Linux
* Name: debianVM
* Description: Debian VM

**CPU and Memory:**
* Change the memory size to 1024 MiB.

**Disks:**
* Select *Create new disk image*.
* Select the Zvol Location.
* Change the size to 30 GiB.

**Network Interface:**
* Attach NIC: Select the physical interface to associate with the VM.

**Installation Media:**
* In this case the installation ISO was uploaded to `/mnt/tank2/isostorage/`. Click on the installation ISO, *debian-11.0.0-amd64-netinst.iso*. 
* If the ISO hadn't been uploaded previously, the user needs to set *Upload an installer image file*, select a dataset to store the ISO, click *Choose file*, then click *Upload*. Wait for the upload to complete (this can take some time).

**GPU:**
* Leave the default values.

**Confirm Options**
* Verify the information is correct and then click *Submit*.

{{< /expand >}}

* Once the VM has been created, start it by expanding the VM entry (down pointing arrow to the right of the VM name) and click *Start*.

* Click *Display* to open a virtual monitor to the VM and see the Debian Graphical Installation screens.

{{< expand "Debian Install Example." "v" >}}

**Debian Graphical Install**
* Press <kbd>Return</kbd> to start the Debian Graphical Install.
* Language: English
* Location: United States
* Keymap: American English

Installation begins

* Continue if the Network Configuration fails.
* Do not configure the network at this time.
* Enter a Hostname.
* Enter the root password and re-enter the root password.
* Enter a New User name.
* Select the username for your account (it should already be filled in).
* Enter and re-enter the password for the user account.
* Choose the time zone, Eastern in this case.

Disk Detection should begin

* Partition disks: select Guided - use entire disk.
* Select the avaialble disk.
* Select "All files in one partition (recommended for new users).
* Select "Finish partitioning and write changes to disk.
* Select "Yes" to "Write the changes to disks?".

Installing the base system

* Select "No" to the question "Scan extra installation media".
* Select "Yes" when asked "Continue without a network mirror".

Installing Software

* Select "No" when asked "Participate in the package usage survey".
* Select Standard system utilities.
* Click *Continue* when the installation is finished.
{{< /expand >}}

* Once the Debian installation is finished, close the Display window.
 
* In the VM's expanded section click *Power Off* to stop the new VM.

* Click *Devices*.

* Remove the CDROM from the Devices by clicking the <i class="fa fa-ellipsis-v" aria-hidden="true" title="Options"></i>&nbsp; and selecting *Delete*. Click *Delete Device*.

* Click Virtualization and expand the new VM by clicking on the down pointing arrow to the right.

* Click *Start*.

* Click *Display*.

**The grub file does not run when the VM is started. This can be done manually after each start.**
At the shell prompt:
* Type FS0: <kbd>Return</kbd>.
* Type cd EFI <kbd>Return</kbd>.
* Type cd Debian <kbd>Return</kbd.
* Type grubx64.efi <kbd>Return</kbd

{{< hint warning >}}
To insure it starts automatically, you will need to create the startup.nsh file at the root directory on the vm. At the shell prompt type *edit startup.nsh*. In the editor type:
* Type FS0: <kbd>Return</kbd.
* Type cd EFI <kbd>Return</kbd.
* Type cd Debian <kbd>Return</kbd.
* Type grubx64.efi <kbd>Return</kbd
* Type the Control+s keys(Command+s for Mac OS) <kbd>Return</kbd.
* Type the Control+q keys to quit.
 
Close the Display window

To test if it now boots up on startup:
* Power off the VM.
* Click *Start*.
* Click *Display*.
* Log into your Debian VM.
