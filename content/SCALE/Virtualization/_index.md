The Virtualization section allows users to set up Virtual Machines (VM's) to run alongside TrueNAS. Delegating processes to VM's reduces the load on the physical system, which means users can utilize additional hardware resources. Users can customize six different segments of a VM when creating one in TrueNAS SCALE.
