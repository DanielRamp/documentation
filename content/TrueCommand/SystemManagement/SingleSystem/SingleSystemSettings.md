## Update

The update button in the system settings menu allows users to update the system to the latest build. During a system update the system card will change to indicate that the system is offline and finishing the update.

## Launch TrueNAS Interface

**Launch TrueNAS Interface** in the system settings menu opens a new browser tab pointed at the system's web interface.

## iSCSI Volumes

The *iSCSI Volumes* button in the system settings menu allows users to filter, create, and delete one or more iSCSI volumes.
